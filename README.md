## Reverse

Have the function Reverse(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the string in reversed order. For example: if the input string is "Hello World and Coders" then your program should return the string sredoC dna dlroW olleH.

### Sample Test Cases
```
Input: "coderbyte"
Output: "etybredoc"
```
```
Input: "I Love Code"
Output: "edoC evoL I"
```

## Even Fibonacci numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Example 1:
```
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```
### Example 3:
```
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
